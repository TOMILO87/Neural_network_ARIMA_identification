# Neural_network_ARIMA_identification
We simulate time series data from an ARIMA model and train a neural network to predict the the model.

A description of the project can be found on my blog: https://lofgrenfinance.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/we-use-a-neural-network-to-identify-unknown-time-series/

The neural network is based on the coursera course: https://www.deeplearning.ai/
